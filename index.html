                        just sliding your cursor over this sharp projection (or follow this link) of image data from the
                        Hubble Space Telescope. Both captured on January 19, during back-to-back 10 hour rotations of
                        the ruling gas giant, the all-planet projections represent the first in a series of planned
                        annual portraits by the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy program. Comparing the two highlights
                        cloud movements and measures wind speeds in the planet's dynamic atmosphere. In fact, the Great
                        Red Spot, the famous long-lived swirling storm boasting 300 mile per hour winds, is seen
                        sporting a rotating, twisting filament. The images confirm that Great Red Spot is still
                        shrinking, though still larger than planet Earth. Posing next to it (lower right) is Oval BA,
                        also known as Red Spot Junior.
